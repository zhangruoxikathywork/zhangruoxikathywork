Hi visitors! I'm Kathy, a motivated and data-driven woman currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Public Policy (STEM) with Finance and Data specializations at the University of Chicago. I completed my undergraduate studies at Brandeis University, majoring in Economics (STEM) & Business, with a minor in Education Studies in May 2022.

As someone passionate about Finance and Data Analytics, I thrive on using quantitative models to tackle challenges in the finance industry and enjoy crafting compelling visualizations to tell a story. My background includes valuable experiences in Financial Industry Consulting, Fixed Income Modeling, Private Equity, FinTech, Portfolio Management, and Equity Research. I am proficient in Python, R, C++, SQL, STATA, TABLEAU, Excel, and Powerpoint, with professional interactions with Mathematica and Fortran.

Beyond my professional interests, I'm an enthusiastic singer, a lover of bullet journals and makeup, and occasionally indulge in video games. Caring, responsible, and a natural leader, I actively seek opportunities to help others and make a positive impact.

Please don't hesitate to connect with me. I'm open to networking and collaboration!
